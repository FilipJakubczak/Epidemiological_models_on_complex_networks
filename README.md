# Epidemiological Models on Complex Networks

My specialized laboratory assignment.

## Summary

Epidemiological models are used to study the dynamics of various types of infections. They can, for example, determine the effectiveness of a given vaccination scheme or the impact of the structure of relationships between people on the course of an epidemic. In most simple models, it is assumed that the population consists of individuals (agents) who can assume one of several specific states (e.g. susceptible to infection, patients, immunized), and the rates of transition between individual states are determined by model parameters.

My goal is to make a script generating Erdos-Renyi (ER), Watts-Strogatz (WS) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) networks and simulating the dynamics of several epidemiological models. I will also perform analysis and comparison of results obtained for various complex networks.
